# ACAFP-Algorithm
Implementation of a modified version of RSA Algorithm to improve computation speed, memory consumption and security by using four prime numbers.

RSA algorithm is a public key encryption technique and is considered as the most secure way of encryption.
It is used for digital signature, e-commerce and key distribution.

The aim of the project is to implement an algorithm similar to RSA algorithm known as ACAFP.
This algorithm uses four prime numbers in key generation unlike RSA which uses two large prime numbers.
After the implementation of the algorithm, a comparison is made in the following components:
 1) Ease of Algorithm Implementation ( Factorization ).
 2) Time Complexity
 3) Memory Consumption
 
Later on, the ACAFP algorithm is extended to other number of prime numbers i.e. 6 and 2, and tested with speed.
